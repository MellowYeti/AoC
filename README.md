# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Hello, welcome to my cosy little christmas code corner. This is where I save my AoC solutions as and when I get round to them.

## Installation
You will need:
- Python ^3.13
- Poetry
- Download the repo and run `poetry install`

## Execution

```shell
poetry run python -m aoc -d {DAY} -y {YEAR}

# Where day is a number between 1-25
```

The system will try to download the relevant input and store it if you have a`SESSION_COOKIE` stored in your environment.
