# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Hello, welcome to my cosy little christmas code corner. This is where I save my AoC solutions as and when I get round to them.

## Installation
You will need:
- Python ^3.13
- Poetry
- Download the repo and run `poetry install`

## Execution
You will need to place your `input.txt` into the relevent folders for each day eg `src/aoc/2024/day_1/input.txt` I may try to automate this step in the future.

```shell
poetry run python -m aoc -d {DAY}
```

Where day is a number between 1-25
